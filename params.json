{"name":"'Red' Alert","tagline":"\" Its just algorithms \" - someone","body":"### Welcome to 'Red' Alert\r\n\r\nThis is a notification system built for the Power BI Team @ Microsoft. The main contoller runs on the raspberry pi. Some parts of the system work in conjuntion with special hardware. An example is the NeoPixel class which uses an XBee to comunicate light sequences to arduinos connected with neopixel strips.\r\n\r\nSetting this up on a raspberry pi is simple, just copy and run setup.py as follows :-\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo python3 setup.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will enlist/install all the required libraries and folder structures. Depending on the hooks required, you might need to create options.csv in /var/www/tmp, and fill as shown\r\n\r\n```\r\nslack_token,your_token\r\nvso_password,your_password\r\nbuildbroken,False\r\ngmail_username,your_username\r\ngmail_password,your_password\r\nvso_username,your_username\r\nweather_key,your_api_id\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, you will also need to create a cronjob to execute runner.py every minute.\r\n\r\n### ITask\r\nITasks are extensible units of the system. It is a script that when run preforms a specific operation. An example is the weather task, which checks the weather in Redmond, and posts it to the timeline. The tasks's __run__(self, time) method takes in a time parameter which can be used to control when a task is run, since the runner will launch all tasks every minute. \r\n\r\nA sample implementation of a task looks like this :-\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom common import ITask\r\n\r\nclass MyTask(ITask):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    def __run__(self, time):\r\n        if time['hour'] == '12' and time['min'] == '00':\r\n            print('Wooo its 12pm!')\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you create a new task, remember to add it to the runner.py, so the runner can launch it.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSachin Patney\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nPart of the Power BI team?
